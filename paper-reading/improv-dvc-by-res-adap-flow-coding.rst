In this work, the authors propose a new framework called Resolution-adaptive Flow Coding (RaFC) to effectively compress the flow maps globally and locally, in which they use multi-resolution representations instead of single-resolution representations for both the input flow maps and the output motion features of the MV encoder.

Experiment results on four benchmark datasets, HEVC, VTL, UVG, and MCL-JCV, demonstrates the effectivenss of the overall RaFC framework for video compression.
