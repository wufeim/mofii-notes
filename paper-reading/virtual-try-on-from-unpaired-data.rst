This paper presents a new image-based virtual try-on approach (Outfit-VITON) that helps visualize how a composition of clothing items selected from various reference images form a cohesive outfit on a person in a query image. The authors provide an inexpensive data collection and training process, and introduce an online optimization capability for virtual try-on that accurately synthesizes fine garment features.
