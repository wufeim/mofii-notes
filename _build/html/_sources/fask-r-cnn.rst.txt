This paper proposes a Fast Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network method (Fast R-CNN) for object detection, which improves training and testing speed and increases detection accuracy compared to R-CNN.

The author points out three drawbacks of R-CNN:

1. **Training is a multi-stage pipeline.**
2. **Training is expensive in space and time.**
3. **Object detection is slow.**

R-CNN is slow becuase it performs a ConvNet forward pass for each object proposal. Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets) were proposed to speed up R-CNN by sharing computation. Features are extracted for a proposal by max-pooling the portion of the feature map inside the proposal into a fixed-size output. However, there are two drawbacks of SPPnet:

- Training is still a multi-stage pipeline.
- Fine-tuning algorithm cannot update the convolutional layers that precede the spatial pyramid pooling
